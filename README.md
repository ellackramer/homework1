homework assignment 1, 3.27.2021, refactoring for accessibility.

In this assignment, I refactored the pre-existing code to meet 2021 ADA and WCAG website accessibility standards. These changes include, but are not limited to adding alt tags and image descriptions, as well as a more concise tab title to make the webpage more accessible via screen reader, in addition to being easy to navigate using only a keyboard for braille keyboards.
